# Learning Generative Adversarial Networks
### Build image generation and semi-supervised models using Generative Adversarial Network

Generative models are gaining a lot of popularity among the data scientists, mainly because they facilitate the building of AI systems that consume raw data from a source and automatically builds an understanding from it. Unlike supervised learning methods, generative models do not require labelling of the data which makes it an interesting system to use. This book will help you to build and analyze the deep learning models and apply them to real-world problems. This book will help readers develop intelligent and creative application from a wide variety of dataset (mainly focusing on visual or images). This book will consists of Python codes that can be directly applied and used in an industrial context and not just academic. Through this book readers will be trained to build GAN models and use them in a production environment.

# R Data Analysis Cookbook - Second Edition
### A journey from Data Analysis to Data Driven Insights

Dive into the world of data science and data analysis leveraging the power of R and analytics to transform data into actionable insights. This book will teach you how you can put your data analysis and machine learning skills in R to practical use, with recipes catering to the basic as well as advanced data analysis tasks. Right from acquiring your data and preparing it for analysis to the more complex data analysis techniques, the book will show you how you can implement each technique in the best possible manner.By the end of this book, you will have all the knowledge you need to become an expert in data analysis with R, and put your skills to test in real-world scenarios. I will also be adding various R scripts and bonus content here from time to time. Keep watching this space!
